update list... for v0.1.7

- Minor bug fix: parsing empty tuplet braces caused a crash 
- Allowed using rests ":" inside tuplets []
- Now you can specify a set number of repeats by {n---}
   ex. {3CDE}, {3{2C:D}}
- PRESET=BEEP sets up a channel for a pure square wave tone
   (this is perfect if you want to make cheap old PC tones :))
- In a file dialog, ALT + D opens the currently selected folder in Explorer
