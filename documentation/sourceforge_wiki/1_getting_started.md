## About BeepComp ##

BeepComp lets you compose chiptune tracks with text files. It features a nice retro-sounding synthesizer engine with 9 music channels and 1 drum channel.


## If you found issues/bugs...

BeepComp is still in its development stage... so I really appreciate you letting me know about any issues you experience. I really want to make a program that is reliable and enjoyable to anyone :)


## Getting Started ##

Use the latest installer package available on the [Sourceforge top page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/beepcomp/). Run this set up file, and you'll be all set for your journey!

#### Windows ####

Launch the MSI installer file you download. Your program will be installed in the folder:

- **C:\Program Files\BeepComp\\** on 32-bit Windows
- **C:\Program Files (x86)\BeepComp\\** on 64-bit Windows

After installation, BeepComp will be on the list of installed programs. On Windows XP & 7, go to Start->All Programs->BeepComp.

#### Mac / Linux ####

I'll be working on these versions soon :)


## Tutorials ##

Some tutorial files are included in the **/userdata** folder inside your installed directory to get you started. Simply load one of these files named **\_tutorial\_---.txt**, read and play to see what you can write into BeepComp and what results you get. I recommend starting from **\_tutorial\_basic\_1.txt**.

These files are located in:

- **C:\Program Files\BeepComp\userdata** on 32-bit Windows
- **C:\Program Files (x86)\BeepComp\userdata** on 64-bit Windows
