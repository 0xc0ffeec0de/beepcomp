Release Notes v0.2.1
====================

Dear users,

The funky, nasally sounds of a pulse waveforms were used everywhere in many old console games so these had to be included in BeepComp's sound arsenal! I also added a simple overdrive effect you can use to "beef up" soft waveforms like sine and triangle waves. You will have fun with these new tools!
I am creating a few forum posts that walk through these new features...
I hope you enjoy this evolved version of BeepComp.
Please always feel free to give me feedback, let me know of any bugs, and share songs you make!

Kind regards,
Hiro

What's new in BeepComp version 0.2.1:

- Introduces pulse waveforms - pulse wave patterns emulate some of the classic sounds of Nintendo's NES
- New "Beef-Up" effect - mild overdrive effect to fatten up your audio signal
- Added a button in the file dialog to go to a particular drive, the 'Desktop' folder or the 'Documents' folder
- Added a help screen in the file dialog to look up key short-cuts
- CTRL + Z in the file dialog: go back to the previous directory you were in
- CTRL + R in the file dialog: refresh the current directory you are viewing
- Now the file dialog will open up to the last saved/loaded directory
- Added a pop-guard algorithm to prevent from getting clicks from sine and triangle waves
- Minor rebalancing in the main UI

Release Notes v0.2.0
====================

Dear users,

I am excited to introduce the new pitch-bend effects! Pitch falls and rises add so much life to melodies. I included a song example where you can see how these bend effects work - play "ys2_palace_of_solomon.txt" and look into the source text... I hope you enjoy these new tools!
For this release, I compiled and uploaded a portable version. If you want a version that can run out of your thumb drive, go to Sourceforge release folder and look for a folder named "portable." 
Thank you for using BeepComp. Your feedback and issue reports are always welcome. Beep on!

Sincerely,
Hiro

Release Notes v0.1.8
====================

Dear users,

Exciting news! The Softpedia website's editorial team has given BeepComp a nice 4-star review, and a 100% Free award certification :) I thank you for using BeepComp! Please always let me know about any issues you might find and things I can do to improve the program.

The version 0.1.8 is a maintenance release (addressing the issue with quick-saving was important).

Sincerely,
Hiro

New in BeepComp version 0.1.8:

- Bug-fix: to prevent the quick-saving function from overwriting the previous save target
  when the user has started a new file or loaded a file
- Now you can use multiple ties within tuplet braces []
- In the previous versions, writing multiple ties in a tuplet group would cause disposition
- Minor bug-fix: opening a NEW dialog after resizing the window was setting incorrect mouse coordinates
- Minor bug-fix: starting a song with a rest was causing a small click noise
- You can now check the version number by clicking the logo

====================
