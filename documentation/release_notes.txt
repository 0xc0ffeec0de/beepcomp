- With the new font, the screen fits a couple of more lines in the editor area
- Minor rebalancing of the screen components

====================
Release Notes v0.1.8
====================

Dear users,

Exciting news! The Softpedia website's editorial team has given BeepComp a nice 4-star review, and a 100% Free award certification :) I thank you for using BeepComp! Please always let me know about any issues you might find and things I can do to improve the program.

The version 0.1.8 is a maintenance release (addressing the issue with quick-saving was important).

Sincerely,
Hiro

New in BeepComp version 0.1.8:

- Bug-fix: to prevent the quick-saving function from overwriting the previous save target
  when the user has started a new file or loaded a file
- Now you can use multiple ties within tuplet braces []
- In the previous versions, writing multiple ties in a tuplet group would cause disposition
- Minor bug-fix: opening a NEW dialog after resizing the window was setting incorrect mouse coordinates
- Minor bug-fix: starting a song with a rest was causing a small click noise
- You can now check the version number by clicking the logo

====================

I focused on making the program more robust, and I will continue on this path.
Thank you for using BeepComp.
I'm grateful for the people who got in touch with me about the bugs, too.
Hope you enjoy this!

Hiro
