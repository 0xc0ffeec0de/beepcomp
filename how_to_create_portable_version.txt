How to create a portable version of BeepComp
============================================

1. Copy the GUI.cpp and Dialog.cpp to files with following names (overwrite):

   GUI_portable.cpp
   Dialog_portable.cpp

2. In GUI_portable.cpp:

   Search with word "PORTABLE" - find spots to adjust..
   Where it says "DECOMMENT", take out the double forward slashes "//"
   Where it says "COMMENT OUT", add double forward slashes "//" at the start of each line
   (Around lines 83-85, 87, 299?)

3. In Dialog_portable.cpp:

   Search with word "PORTABLE" - find spots to adjust..
   Where it says "DECOMMENT", take out the double forward slashes "//"
   Where it says "COMMENT OUT", add double forward slashes "//" at the start of each line
   (Around line 134?)

4. Compile with:

   Make -j 2 portable2

5. Copy the produced file beepcomp_portable.exe into /portable/beepcomp_vX-X-X_portable directory (overwrite)

6. Copy README.txt and READ.md with the updated version number to that beepcomp_vX-X-X_portable folder

7. Zip up that beepcomp_vX-X-X_portable folder!
